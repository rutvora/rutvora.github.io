I am Rut Vora, a student pursuing Masters (Thesis) in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver.  
I currently work as a Research Assistant in [Systopia](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/).
I previously worked as a Software Engineer II in the [Office of the CTO](https://www.f5.com/company/octo) at [F5, Inc.](https://f5.com)  
At F5, I created Proof-of-concepts with cutting edge technologies like:
