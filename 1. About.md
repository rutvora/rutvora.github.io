I am Rut Vora, an incoming student for Masters (Thesis) in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver.  
I currently work in the [Office of the CTO](https://www.f5.com/company/octo) at [F5, Inc.](https://f5.com)  
Here, I create Proof-of-concepts with cutting edge technologies like:
  1. extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF)
  2. DataPlane Development Kit (DPDK) and F-stack
  3. P4 (P4lang)
  4. WebAssembly (WASM) and WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)

I am interested in Systems and Networks, especially Systems and Networks Security.

I completed my undergraduate in Computer Science from BITS Pilani (2016-2020)
